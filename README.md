In my role as an analyst, I undertook the responsibility of conducting a descriptive analysis on a video game dataset. The aim was to gain deeper insights into how GameCo's new games could perform in the market. The dataset encompassed historical sales data across various platforms, genres, and publishing studios. I utilized Excel along with skills such as data grouping, summarization, descriptive analysis techniques, and visualizing results within Excel. Subsequently, I presented the findings derived from these analyses.
The executive board's perception of consistent sales across different geographic regions presumed a static trend over time. Nevertheless, my analysis contradicted this assumption, prompting a reassessment of their hypothesis and necessitating a revision in their expectations.
